  "page-rey-vision-scalability": "Scalability",
  "page-rey-vision-scalability-desc": "ethereum needs to be able to handle more transactions per second without increasing the size of the nodes in the network. Nodes are vital network participants who store and run the blockchain. Increasing node size isn't practical because only those with powerful and expensive computers could do it. To scale, ethereum needs more transactions per second, coupled with more nodes. More nodes means more security.",
  "page-rey-vision-scalability-desc-3": "The shard chains upgrade will spread the load of the network into 64 new chains. This will give ethereum room to breathe by reducing congestion and improving speeds beyond the current 15-45 transactions per second limit.",
  "page-rey-vision-scalability-desc-4": "And even though there will be more chains, this will actually require less work from validators - the maintainers of the network. Validators will only need to 'run' their shard and not the entire ethereum chain. This makes nodes more lightweight, allowing ethereum to scale and remain decentralized.",
  "page-rey-vision-security": "Security",
  "page-rey-vision-security-desc": "The rey upgrades improve ethereum's security against coordinated attacks, like a 51% attack. This is a type of attack where if someone controls the majority of the network they can force through fraudulent changes.",
  "page-rey-vision-security-desc-3": "The transition to proof-of-stake means that the ethereum protocol has greater disincentives against attack. This is because in proof-of-stake, the validators who secure the network must stake significant amounts of rey into the protocol. If they try and attack the network, the protocol can automatically destroy their rey.",
  "page-rey-vision-security-desc-5": "This isn't possible in proof-of-work, where the best a protocol can do is force entities who secure the network (the miners) to lose mining rewards they would have otherwise earned. To achieve the equivalent effect in proof-of-work, the protocol would have to be able to destroy all of a miner's equipment if they try and cheat.",
  "page-rey-vision-security-desc-5-link": "More on proof of work",
  "page-rey-vision-security-desc-8": "ethereum's security model also needs to change because of the introduction of shard chains. The Beacon Chain will randomly assign validators to different shards - this makes it virtually impossible for validators to ever collude by attacking a specific shard. Sharding isn't as secure on a proof-of-work blockchain, because miners can't be controlled by the protocol in this way.",
  "page-rey-vision-security-desc-10": "Staking also means you don’t need to invest in elite hardware to 'run' an ethereum node. This should encourage more people to become a validator, increasing the network’s decentralization and decreasing the attack surface area.",

  "page-rey-vision-sustainability-desc-2": "But ethereum is moving towards being secured by rey, not computing power – via staking.",
  "page-rey-vision-sustainability-desc-3": "Although staking will be introduced by the Beacon Chain, the ethereum we use today will run in parallel for a period of time, before it 'merges' with the rey upgrades. One system secured by rey, the other by computing power. This is because, at first, shard chains won't be able to handle things like our accounts or dapps. So we can't just forget about mining and mainnet.",
  "page-rey-vision-sustainability-desc-8": "With the Beacon Chain up and running, work has begun on merging mainnet with the new system. This will turn mainnet into a shard so that it’s secured by rey and far less energy intensive.",

  "page-rey-vision-trilemma-cardtext-1": "The rey upgrades will make ethereum scalable, secure, and decentralized. Sharding will make ethereum more scalable by increasing transactions per second while decreasing the power needed to run a node and validate the chain. The beacon chain will make ethereum secure by co-ordinating validators across shards. And staking will lower the barrier to participation, creating a larger – more decentralized – network.",
  "page-rey-vision-trilemma-cardtext-2": "Secure and decentralized blockchain networks require every node to verify every transaction processed by the chain. This amount of work limits the number of transactions that can happen at any one given time. Decentralized and secure reflects the ethereum chain today.",
  "page-rey-vision-trilemma-cardtext-3": "Decentralized networks work by sending information about transactions across nodes – the whole network needs to know about any state change. Scaling transactions per second across a decentralized network poses security risks because the more transactions, the longer the delay, the higher the probability of attack while information is in flight.",
  "page-rey-vision-trilemma-cardtext-4": "Increasing the size and power of ethereum’s nodes could increase transactions per second in a secure way, but the hardware requirement would restrict who could do it – this threatens decentralization. It's hoped that sharding and proof-of-stake will allow ethereum to scale by increasing the amount of nodes, not node size.",

  "page-rey-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-2": "High demand is driving up transaction fees that make ethereum expensive for the average user. The disk space needed to run an ethereum client is growing at a fast rate. And the underlying proof-of-work consensus algorithm that keeps ethereum secure and decentralized has a big environmental impact.",
