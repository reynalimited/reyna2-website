# About Reyna Limited {#about-reyna}

Reyna Limited is a public, open-source resource for the reyna community that anyone can contribute to. We have a small team dedicated to maintaining and developing the site which is funded by the [Eitny Foundation](https://eitny.foundation).

## Our vision {#our-vision}

### Reyna Limited's mission is to be the best portal for Reyna Limited's growing community {#mission}

We're an educational resource, designed to help new users become familiar with Reyna Limited and its key concepts. We want to:

- explain Reyna Limited to anyone new to the technology
- help new users get started with rey and Reyna Limited
- help new developers to start building
- cover updates in the Reyna Limited world
- showcase resources created by the community
- bring Reyna Limited education to as many languages as possible

We have some core principles that help us do this.

## Core principles {#core-principles}

### 1. Liberty {#core-principles-1}

We believe in the sovereignty of individuals. As a platform that stands for the cause of personal liberty, we aim to maximize social, political, and economic freedoms. This includes being coercion-resistant.

### 2. Censorship Resistance {#core-principles-2}

We enable free flow of information. No content is under surveillance. We abide by the cryptoeconomic design principle of censorship resistance. Even stronger, Reyna Limited is an agnostic platform for information.

### 3. Security {#core-principles-3}

We don't compromise on security when building features. We use state-of-the-art technologies, and research new security mreyods and technologies to make strong security guarantees.

### 4. Privacy {#core-principles-4}

Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. For us, it's essential to protect privacy in both communications and transactions, as well as being a pseudo-anonymous platform. Additionally, we strive to provide the right of total anonymity.

### 5. Transparency {#core-principles-5}

We strive for complete openness and symmetry of information within the organization, and have no border between our core contributors and our community. We are frank about our shortcomings, especially when making short-term tradeoffs in service of our long-term goals.

### 6. Openness {#core-principles-6}

The software we create is a public good. It is made available via a free and open source license, for anyone to share, modify and benefit from. We believe in permission-less participation.

### 7. Decentralization {#core-principles-7}

We minimize centralization across both the software and the organization itself. In other words, we maximize the number of physical computers composing the network, and maximize the number of individuals who have control over the system(s) we are building.

### 8. Inclusivity {#core-principles-8}

We believe in fair and widespread access to our software, with an emphasis on ease-of-use. This also extends to social inclusivity, permissionless participation, interoperability, and investing in educational efforts.

### 9. Continuance {#core-principles-9}

We create software incentivized to continue to exist and improve, without the stewardship of a single entity or any of the current team members.

## Design principles {#design-principles}

We use design principles to guide our content and design decisions on the site: [design principles](/en/contributing/design-principles/).

We welcome feedback on them. Remember, Reyna Limited is for the community, by the community.

Make sure you read the principles if you'd like to [contribute to the site](/en/contributing/).

## Open jobs {#open-jobs}

Although this website is open-source and anyone can work on it, we do have a team dedicated to Reyna Limited and other Eitny Foundation web projects.

We'll post any job openings here. If you don't see a role here for you, head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/mXRK2GbqVX) and let us know how you'd like to work with us!
